# visuals:md-to-scrolldeck — Markdown → vertical scroll-snap deck

## Help

If arg #1 is `-h`, `--help`, or `help`, read `references/help.md` and
output its content verbatim, then stop. **No file reads, no file writes.**

## Step 1: Parse Args + Validate Input

Required positional: exactly one `<input.md>`. Flags: `--out <path>`,
`--slides <n>`, `--outline-only`, `--lang <code>`, `--offline-font`,
`--no-open` — full table in `references/help.md`.

Missing/unreadable path → `[FAIL] visuals:md-to-scrolldeck: input not found:
<path>` + exit 1. Two+ positionals → `[FAIL] one Markdown file per run`.
Non-`.md` extension → `[WARN]`, not a stop.

Output path: `--out <path>` if given, else input's dir + basename with
`.html` (`docs/vision.md` → `docs/vision.html`); overwrite silently if it
already exists, but say so in the final report.

## Step 2: Read + Outline (do not skip)

Read the **entire** document first — you need the ending to know what the
opening should set up. Then apply `references/slide-curation.md` to compress
it into narrative beats; this is the skill's main quality lever, not a
1:1 heading→slide `map()` (see that file for why).

Print the **nav-dot outline** (id, label, archetype, `data-phase`, source
lines, plus what was cut — format in `slide-curation.md` → Step C) before
writing any HTML.

- `--outline-only` → stop here.
- Fewer than 5 beats → `[WARN] too short — visuals:visualize one-pager fits better` and ask before continuing.
- More than 20 beats → propose a scope cut, don't silently build 30 slides.
- Otherwise → continue without waiting for approval; the printed outline is what lets the user interrupt, not a blocking prompt.

## Step 3: Build, Write, Verify, Deliver

Copy `references/scroll-deck-skeleton.md` and replace its `YOUR ... HERE`
tokens — **never write this HTML from scratch**. The chrome is load-bearing
and `references/checklist.md` enumerates and greps for every piece of it —
do not drop any of it.

Per-slide: pick the archetype from the outline, vary the slide treatment so no
three are identical, write real content only (never placeholder text or
invented figures). Keep the CDN webfont link; base64-embed only behind
`--offline-font`, after warning — see `references/font-and-bedrock-safety.md`.
`references/checklist.md` also lists what to never add back — it is
deliberately out of scope here.

Then, in this order: (1) **one `Write` call** for the whole file — see
`font-and-bedrock-safety.md` § 2 for why one call, no chat echo; (2) run
`bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/lib/verify-html.sh" --profile deck <out>.html`,
which must exit 0 — every `[FAIL]` gets fixed and rewritten before you
report, never report a broken dot rail as `[OK]` — then the judgement items
in `references/checklist.md`; (3) auto-open unless `--no-open` (`xdg-open`
on Linux/WSL, `open` on macOS — never `wslview`, it errors on HTML).

Report:

```
[OK] visuals:md-to-scrolldeck slides=<n> out=<path>
file://<absolute-path>
```

Follow with the slide-id list and what was cut. Waived checklist items are
`[WARN] <item>: <reason>`, never silent.

Next: `Review the deck, or re-run with --slides <n> / --outline-only to
adjust the curation before another build.`
